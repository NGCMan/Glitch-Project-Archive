This is an archival of all the glitch.me projects I've either made or worked on because apparently the service is going to be shut down in 2026.

I'll add more information to each project later, I've already spent almost an hour archiving all this stuff.

tl;dr: Just pick a project and run it. Knowledge of Antimatter Dimensions is **highly** recommended.

# Bakery Shop

[Play here!](https://raw.githack.com/NGCMan/Glitch-Project-Archive/main/Bakery%20Shop/index.html)

A game inspired by [Get A Little Gold.](https://www.kongregate.com/games/jarofed/get-a-little-gold) Though as you can see, the game was created in a day and quickly abandoned. The buttons on the top don't do anything, all you can do in this game is print money, and wait. There's really not much to it.
