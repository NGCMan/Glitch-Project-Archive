This is an archival of all the glitch.me projects I've either made or worked on because apparently the service is going to be shut down in 2026.

I'll add more information to each project later, I've already spent almost an hour archiving all this stuff.

tl;dr: Just pick a project and run it. Knowledge of Antimatter Dimensions is **highly** recommended.

# Bakery Shop

[Play here!](https://raw.githack.com/NGCMan/Glitch-Project-Archive/main/Bakery%20Shop/index.html)

A game inspired by [Get A Little Gold.](https://www.kongregate.com/games/jarofed/get-a-little-gold) Though as you can see, the game was created in a day and quickly abandoned. The buttons on the top don't do anything, all you can do in this game is print money, and wait. There's really not much to it.

# Battle Replicants

[Play here!](https://raw.githack.com/NGCMan/Glitch-Project-Archive/main/Battle%20Replicants/index.html)

An RPG project idea concieved by yourself7528, and coded by me and usavictor2. (I don't remember if yourself7528 did any programming or not, it's possible that they did, though.) The term "replicants" refers to the Antimatter Dimensions mechanic of the same name. Looking at the code, it says "Welcome to battle replicants, a game idea that never made NG+++ turned into a game", where NG+++ refers to a popular Antimatter Dimensions mod, which you can play [here.](https://aarextiaokhiao.github.io/NG-plus-3/) (Go into the options menu and click "Convert to NG+3" to begin.)

Unfortunately, I can't get very far in the game to explain any further, as the page seems to crash pretty soon after playing it. ~~Maybe I should pester usavictor about it later.~~
