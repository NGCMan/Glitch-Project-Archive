Picture this: It's 2019, and you're a huge fan of the incremental game [Antimatter Dimensions.](https://ivark.github.io/AntimatterDimensions/) You've completed the game, and decided to check out the modding community while you wait for the upcoming update, blissfully unaware that it's still three years away. To stave off boredom, you do a variety of things. You check out the various Antimatter Dimensions mods, you play games inspired by Antimatter Dimensions, you interact with the community, and most importantly for this particular case, **you decide to learn how to code.** One day, you learn from one of the people you interact with online about a website called glitch.me, a programming website that has a unique feature: *collaborative, real-time editing.* Over the next two years, you and your online friends decide to mess around with it and create silly little projects to share with each other.

Years later, you get a wave of nostalgia and decide to look back at these old projects, only to find out that the service is going to be shut down in 2026. Not wanting the shared memories to be lost to time, you decide to archive everything the website let you to.

**With that introductory statement out of the way, welcome to the Glitch Project Archive.**

# DISCLAIMER

This project isn't done yet! Not every game is working, and most games do not have a description at all. However, you can still get them to work yourself if you know how to code... though I'll tell you now, most of the games here aren't very good, so your efforts won't be worth it in the end.

# Bakery Shop

[Play here!](https://raw.githack.com/NGCMan/Glitch-Project-Archive/main/Bakery%20Shop/index.html)

A game inspired by [Get A Little Gold.](https://www.kongregate.com/games/jarofed/get-a-little-gold) Though as you can see, the game was created in a day and quickly abandoned. The buttons on the top don't do anything, all you can do in this game is print money, and wait. There's really not much to it.

# Battle Replicants

[Play here!](https://raw.githack.com/NGCMan/Glitch-Project-Archive/main/Battle%20Replicants/index.html)

An RPG project idea concieved by yourself7528, and coded by me and usavictor2. (I don't remember if yourself7528 did any programming or not, it's possible that they did, though.) The term "replicants" refers to the Antimatter Dimensions mechanic of the same name. Looking at the code, it says "Welcome to battle replicants, a game idea that never made NG+++ turned into a game", where NG+++ refers to New Game Plus 3, a popular Antimatter Dimensions mod, which you can play [here.](https://aarextiaokhiao.github.io/NG-plus-3/) (Go into the options menu and click "Convert to NG+3" to begin.)

Unfortunately, I can't get very far in the game to explain any further, as the page seems to crash pretty soon after playing it. ~~Maybe I should pester usavictor about it later.~~

# Communist Incremental

[Play here!](https://raw.githack.com/NGCMan/Glitch-Project-Archive/main/Communist%20Incremental/index.html)

So... this requires a bit of background information. Glitch allows you to work on a project collaboratively, and that's exactly what I did with this game. *Anyone* could join the project and edit the code... and in case you couldn't tell, that's why it's called Communist Incremental. The contributors also got paid equally as well! (Disclaimer: This project was free so I don't owe them squat.)

Yes, I know this is not how communism works, but what did you expect? I was just a dumb teenager trying to crack a joke, leave me alone.

For better or worse, this is one of the best games in the archive. (Personally, I think Ordinal Markup Plus is the only other good one.) Due to its nature as a (mostly unplanned) collaborative project, a lot of buttons go unused. The goal of the game is to grow potatoes, and purchase multipliers, reach infinity, buy beetroots, and ultimately, Rip Aarex.

Oh, right, I should *probably* explain what that means. Rip Aarex, (usually stylized as :ripaarex:) was an inside joke used to refer to a prestige layer, and it was named after Aarex, the Developer of NG+++. The image presented is the Discord emoji used as part of the joke. (If I remember correctly, I *believe* it was once used in the NG+3 server, but it's not there anymore. Shame.)

On a final note, Boney M.'s Rasputin was used as background music in the original project, but I removed that feature because I do *not* want a DMCA takedown on this repository, even though the chances of that happening are pretty slim. Still, better safe than sorry!
