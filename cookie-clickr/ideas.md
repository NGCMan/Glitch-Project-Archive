||Pre-Refactor (done)||
|Buildings (done)|
Buildings produce cookies without you having to manually click for cookies. There are 3 different buildings. Here they are:
Cursors: 1 cookie/tick (base cost 15, 1.1x cost mult)
Workers: 10 cookies/tick (base cost 100, 1.1x cost mult) 
Super Cursors: 1 cursor/tick (base cost 15000, 1.1x cost mult)
|Upgrades (done)|
There are 2 different upgrades that boost your production. Here they are:
Click Power Upgrade: +1 more cookies/click (base cost 100, 2x cost mult)
Tickspeed Upgrade: Reduces tick interval by 11% (base cost 1000, 2x cost mult)
|Refactoring (done)|
When you reach 100,000 cookies, you can refactor. When you refactor, you will lose everything, but gain some refactor essence (RE). RE can be spent on many things. RE gives a multiplier to all production as well, so RE is quite valuable.
||Refactor (currently working on)||
|ReCursors (done)|
ReCursors can be bought with RE. ReCursors produce refactor power, which adds an additional multiplier to your production. Refactor power gets reset on refactor.
|Refactor Upgrades (done)|
There are 3 refactor upgrades. The first 2 are repeatable. Here they are:
RE Mult: You gain 5x more RE (base cost 50 RE, 10x cost mult)
ReCursor Upgrade: ReCursors are 3x more powerful (base cost 100 RE, 5x cost mult)
Unlock wizards: Unlock wizards (costs 1000 RE)
|Wizards (currently working on)|
Wizards are the next step of the refactor era. Wizards generate mana, which can be used to cast spells. Every wizard produces 1 mana every 10 seconds. But, to store mana, you need storage capsules. Every storage capsule stores 100 mana. So, if you had 3 storage capsules, you can store 300 mana.
There are also 4 spells. Here they are:
Timewarp: Get 10 minutes of production (100 mana)
Cookie Cloning: Doubles your cookie amount by default (300 mana)
Ultra Clicks: You click RE instead of cookies for 10 seconds with no multipliers (300 mana)
Essence Cloning: Triples your RE amount by default (500 mana)
|Black Hole|
You unlock the black hole at 1000000 RE. The black hole produces black hole energy (BHE) every BHE tick. BHE tickspeed can be sped up by feeding the black hole cookies, RE, or mana. When you have enough BHE, you can get a reward. Rewards boost progression. Here are the first 8 rewards:
Reward 1: Refactor upgrades cost 2x less (100 BHE)
Reward 2: Spells cost 2x less mana (5000 BHE)
Reward 3: Wizards generate 3x more mana (250,000 BHE)
Reward 4: All cloning spells are 5x instead of 2x or 3x (12,500,000 BHE)
Reward 5: Unlock Building Automator (50,000,000 BHE)
Reward 6: Unlock Upgrade Automator (100,000,000 BHE)
Reward 7: Unlock Refactor Automator (1,000,000,000 BHE)
Reward 8: Unlock Autocasting (10,000,000,000 BHE)
|Automators|
Automators automatically buy what are meant to buy. You can toggle automators by going to the Automator tab, or you can press A to toggle all automator on or off.
|Autocasting|
You can only autocast one spell at a time. You must click one of the "Autocast" buttons to automatically cast the spell when you're able to.
|Retirement|
When you reach 1 trillion RE, you can retire, gaining retirement essence (RTE). Retiring will reset everything except for retirement-level content. It will take a long time to gain everything back, but you can do it.
||Retirement/Post-Refactor||
|Retirement Upgrades|
RTE can be spent on retirement upgrades. There are 4 retirement upgrades. The first 3 are repeatable. Here they are:
RTE Mult: You gain 2x more RTE (base cost 10 RTE, 10x cost mult)
BHE Mult: You gain 3x more BHE (base cost 20 RTE, 4x cost mult)
Cost Upgrade: Building, upgrade, ReCursor, and refactor upgrade cost scaling is 8% smaller (base cost 30 RTE, 2x cost mult)
9-16: Unlock new black hole rewards (costs 100 RTE)
|Refactor Trials|
Refactor Trials are where depending on how many times you refactored, you will gain a boost or QoL improvement. Here they are:
50x refactored: You gain 10x more RE
25x refactored: RTE boosts refactor power production
10x refactored: Wizards cost 2x less
5x refactored: Unlock Overclock
|Black Hole Rewards 9-16|
These rewards are even better than rewards 1-8! Here they are:
Reward 9: Refactor power doesn't reset on refactor (1 trillion BHE)
Reward 10: Storage capsules store 3x more mana (1 quadrillion BHE)
Reward 11: ReCursors don't reset on retirement (1 quintillion BHE)
Reward 12: 1000000x boost to all building production (1 sextillion BHE)
Reward 13: ReCursor Automator (10 sextillion BHE)
Reward 14: Refactor Upgrade Automator (100 sextillion BHE)
Reward 15: Magic Automator; wizards & storage capsule automator (1 septillion BHE)
Reward 16: Retirement Automator (1 octillion BHE)
|Overclock|
If you have 10000 RTE, you can overclock a refactor. When a refactor is overclocked, you can get Broken Essence (BE) alongside your RE. BE can be used to buy special overclock upgrades. Here they are:
1. Gain 3x more BE on an overclocked refactor (base cost 1000 BE, 5x cost mult)
2. Black hole rewards require 1.1x less BHE (base cost 10000 BE, 5x cost mult)
3. BE formula is better. (base cost 1000000 BE, 50x cost mult)
