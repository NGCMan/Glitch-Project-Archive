Today, we cover Roman notation and mobile's Greek Letters notation. We might do Aarex's fork's Greek notation some other day, but not today. Aarex has all these options that I don't know the point of. Also, I'll probably stop posting these daily.

First, Roman notation. 0 is nulla. Infinity is Infinitus. Negation uses the minus sign. (When checking what -Infinity is, I found that apparently notation.format(-Infinity) always gives the same result as notation.format(Infinity) for every notation, and notation.format(new Decimal(Infinity).negate()) acts as if it's formatting a very large but not infinitely so negative number.) Numbers between 0 and 4 million (including 0, excluding 4 million) are formatted with Roman numerals. That is, the number is rounded down to have one base-10 decimal place of precision, then each place is mapped to a Roman numeral via the following table (places that are zero don't get represented), then the places are concatenated in the usual order (most to least significant) with no separators. The table is.

|place|1|2|3|4|5|6|7|8|9|
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|1000000|M̄|M̄M̄|M̄M̄M̄|N/A|N/A|N/A|N/A|N/A|N/A|
|100000|C̄|C̄C̄|C̄C̄C̄|C̄D̄|D̄|D̄C̄|D̄C̄C̄|D̄C̄C̄C̄|C̄M̄|
|10000|X̄|X̄X̄|X̄X̄X̄|X̄L̄|L̄|L̄X̄|L̄X̄X̄|L̄X̄X̄X̄|X̄C̄|
|1000|Ⅿ|ⅯⅯ|ⅯⅯⅯ|ⅯV̄|V̄|V̄Ⅿ|V̄ⅯⅯ|V̄ⅯⅯⅯ|ⅯX̄|
|100|Ⅽ|ⅭⅭ|ⅭⅭⅭ|ⅭⅮ|Ⅾ|ⅮⅭ|ⅮⅭⅭ|ⅮⅭⅭⅭ|ⅭⅯ|
|10|Ⅹ|ⅩⅩ|ⅩⅩⅩ|ⅩⅬ|Ⅼ|ⅬⅩ|ⅬⅩⅩ|ⅬⅩⅩⅩ|ⅩⅭ|
|1|Ⅰ|ⅠⅠ|ⅠⅠⅠ|ⅠⅤ|Ⅴ|ⅤⅠ|ⅤⅠⅠ|ⅤⅠⅠⅠ|ⅠⅩ|
|1/10|·|:|∷|⁙|Ｓ|Ｓ·|Ｓ:|Ｓ∷|Ｓ⁙|

The N/A's stand for "Not applicable". Yes, 99 is ⅩⅭⅠⅩ, and that's correct. Note that lots of the characters above look like familiar characters, but they're not. The handling of the 1/10th place is weird (it seems duodecimal, but it skips some numbers, like three dots). It's due to `Math.round(Math.floor(value * 10) * 1.2)` (at this point the value is just the fractional part), which only cares about the first Decimal place of the value (that's what shows up in `Math.floor(value * 10)`). The actual algorithm uses a smaller table (it treats ⅩⅩⅩ, for example, as three Ⅹ's rather than as its own thing, and treats ⅬⅩ as Ⅼ followed by Ⅹ), but the difference is not that important.

For numbers greater than or equal to four million, the mantissa is defined as the number divided by four million to the power of the floor of (the number's log base four million), the exponent is defined as the number's log base four million, then the mantissa and exponent are formatted and the final result is the formatted mantissa followed by ↑ followed by the formatted exponent. Note that the exponent doesn't have to be an integer, and so may have a fractional part. This means that the mantissa and exponent have some redundant information (for example, if the mantissa is greater than 10, the exponent will have a fractional part greater than 0.1 and thus some fractional part will be displayed). Also, the exponent can have its own mantissa and exponent. In this case, the above procedure still works, and to be concrete the result is (original mantissa)↑(exponent's mantissa)↑(exponent's exponent).

To be concrete, let's format 1e4000. The log base four million is 605.8715015092473, so that's the exponent. The floor of that is 605, and 1e4000/4000000^605 is 567159.5465055975, so that's the mantissa. Both the mantissa and exponent are less than 4000000. Formatting the mantissa, we round down to 567159.5, do table lookups giving us D̄, L̄X̄, V̄ⅯⅯ, Ⅽ, Ⅼ, ⅠⅩ, Ｓ, and concatenate to get D̄L̄X̄V̄ⅯⅯⅭⅬⅠⅩＳ. Formatting the exponent, we round down to 605.8, do table lookups giving us ⅮⅭ, nothing, Ⅴ, Ｓ∷, and concatenate to get ⅮⅭⅤＳ∷. So 1e4000 formatted is D̄L̄X̄V̄ⅯⅯⅭⅬⅠⅩＳ↑ⅮⅭⅤＳ∷, which is indeed the correct answer.

Now, Greek Letters notation. 0 is 0, minus is the minus sign, Infinity is Infinity. It's almost just letters with 49 letters άαβγδεζηθικλμνξοπρστυφχψωΑΒΓΔΕΖΗΘΙΚΛΜΝΞΟΠΡΣΤΥΦΧΨΩ, ά followed by the 24 lowercase greek letters (with non-final sigma but not final sigma) followed by the 24 uppercase greek letters. More precisely, as with letters, the mantissa is the mantissa base 1000 and is formatted as a usual number base 1000 with the given precision (so with precision 2 and mantissa 748.27658, the mantissa would be 748.28). If the number is less than 1000, it's formatted normally (as if it were the mantissa, except with the under-1000 precision rather than the usual precision). If the number is at least 1000, the exponent is the exponent base 1000 (rounded down to an integer, as usual but unlike in Roman notation), and is formatted in base 49 with the above digits. The number is then formatted as the formatted mantissa, followed by a space, followed by the formatted exponent. For example, 1e4000, in base 1000, has mantissa 10 and exponent 1333. 1333 in base 49 is 27 10, which becomes Γκ using the above 49 digits. So 1e4000 is formatted as 10.00 Γκ with precision 2, or generally 10.[n zeros] Γκ with positive precision n. Indeed, this is correct (though in some environments κ looks like a small capital K, and in others it looks more like a lowercase x or a small aleph).
