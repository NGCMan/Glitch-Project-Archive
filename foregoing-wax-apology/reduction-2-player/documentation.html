  <h3><strong>Gameplay:</strong></h3>
  <br/>
  <span>Basic gameplay: Reduction is played on a square board of some size which the players can choose (side length between 10 and 20). Each space of this board is either empty or full; the board starts out with each space randomly empty or full. In Reduction, players make changes to the board; indeed, making changes to the board is basically the only allowed action. There are three types of change; each of these types affects only a 2x2 region of the board and can be done by clicking near the center intersection of that 2x2 region (if you can make a change on a 2x2 region, that region's center intersection will be green). The first type is to take an entirely empty 2x2 region and make it entirely full. The second type is the reverse of the first, namely, to take an entirely full 2x2 region and make it entirely empty. The third type is to take a 2x2 region with only two spaces filled and with those two spaces separated by a diagonal (rather than one being directly above or to the left of the other), and to flip all the spaces in that 2x2 region, resulting in that region still having two diagonally separared full spaces but with those spaces being the other two spaces in the region.</span>

  <span>On their turn, players can make up to some number of changes to the board. Like the board size, this number of changes is chosen by the players at the start of the game (at least 5, no upper bound). The goal of each player on their turn is to reduce the number of full spaces from its value at the start of their turn. As soon as they do this, their turn ends. However, if they make the maximum allowed number of changes per turn without reducing the number of full spaces, the game ends and they lose (the other play wins). Since the board only has a finite number of full spaces to start with, and after every turn either the number of full spaces decreases or the game ends, the game will eventually end after a finite number of turns (with one player winning). One might be concerned that all the spaces would be emptied, but in that case the player who empties all the spaces will win since there is no way to make the number of full spaces lower than zero, and thus the other player will not be able to do that and will lose at the end of their turn.</span>
